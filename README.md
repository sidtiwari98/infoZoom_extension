# infoZoom_extension

A simple Chrome extension that returns the images and meaning related to the highlighted text so that time is not wasted to open a new tab and search for something. This will help while coming across terms and words in articles you don't know or while playing the game scribbl (https://skribbl.io/) where time is a major factor.
This extension is a rough dummy for the "Lookup" feature in MacOS.
