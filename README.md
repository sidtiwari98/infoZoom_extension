# infoZoom_extension

A simple Chrome extension for personal use that returns the images and Wiki related to the highlighted text so that time is not wasted to open a new tab and search for something. This will help while coming across terms and words in articles that one doesn't know or while playing the game scribbl where the images will help to get a rough idea of the drawing(https://skribbl.io/).
Since time is a major factor in this game opening another tab and searching for the word there will make one loose.
This extension is also a rough dummy for the "Lookup" feature in MacOS.
